---------------------------------
>   what is HTML?
Ans> HTML is a way of displaying Web pages with text and images or multimedia content.HTML is not a programming language, but a markup language. An HTML file is a text file containing small markup tags. The markup tags tell the web browser, such as Mozila Firefox or Google Chrome, how to display the page. An HTML file must have an htm or html file extension. HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language.

2> Html pages are of two types:
    > Static Pages- Static Pages, as the name indicates, comparise static content(text or images).So you can only see the contents of a web page without being able to have any interaction with it.

    > Dynamic pages: Dynamic pages are those where the content of the web page depend on user input. So interaction with the user is required in order to display the webb page.For example. consider a web page which requires a number to be entered from the user in order to find out if it is enven or odd. When then user enters the number and clicks on the appropriate button, the number is sent to the web server, which in turn returns the result to the user in an HTML page.
